# Sydney-Airbnb
The goal of this project is to create a visualization that helps Airbnb customers in the city of Sydney choose the suburb of the city in which to rent a property based on their needs by providing them with an overview of rental prices.
In addition, it can give them an idea of how cheap or expensive a particular rental is compared to the trend in the suburb.
